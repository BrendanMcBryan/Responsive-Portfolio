          Hello and welcome to my little bio page. My name is Brendan and I am
          currently enrolled in the PENN LPS Tech Bootcamp. This website, along
          with this text, was created in order to illustrate my knowledge of
          HTML and CSS.

          I live with my wife Gahl, and my and two cats, io and oi, in the Rail
          Park neighborhood of Philadelphia. Never Heard of it? Fair enough,
          these real estate PR releases don't always take. Rail Park is a small
          city park east of Broad and north of Vine. It really is a beautiful
          urban park and you should check it out yourself.
